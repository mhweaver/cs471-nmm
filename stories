User story 1 (Matt): As president of the Western Idaho Ancient Boardgame Club, 
                     I would like to be able to play the game Nine Men's Morris 
                     against another club member. We are both familiar with the 
                     rules of the game and promise to play by them, so there is 
                     no need for the game to enforce the rules for us.

User story 2 (Matt): As a lowly soldier in Rome's 17th legion, I desire to 
                     demonstrate my tactical abilities to my commander, in order 
                     to secure a promotion. Since the command heirarchy seems 
                     fond of Nine Men's Morris, I want to master that game; 
                     however I have never played. I do not want to embarass 
                     myself in front of my cohorts, so I want to be able to 
                     practice against some sort of magic, invisible player of a 
                     relatively low skill level. 
                     
User story 3 (Zakk): As a player suffering for amnesia I sometimes forget where 
					 I clicked. I would like each the piece I am trying to move 
					 during phase 2 to be highlighed so I don't forget.
					 
User story 4 (Zakk): As a person with poor short term memory I can't keep track of how
					 many pieces I have. I would like a counter to show how many pieces
					 I have left.
